If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem. 2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you‚Äôre on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.

For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don‚Äôt have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.

4,Phone is great but iOS sucks,"First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical. Now let's talk about the cell phone itself. It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now ::- iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint. let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:- 1. Notifications - You can't reply through notifications. - Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages) - if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol). - Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications. 2. App library - It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that. 3. whatsapp - Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes. - To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process. - Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS) - You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too. The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience. I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing. I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing. 30 people found this helpful Helpful Report",128GB,N/A,Yes

6,How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ‚Çπ 84900. After credit card discount(‚Çπ6000), old phone exchange(‚Çπ3450) and reward points money(‚Çπ4530) inclusion, I bought it for ‚Çπ70920. There‚Äôs also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn‚Äôt let go of blue 1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it‚Äôd cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year. 2: DISPLAY: I‚Äôve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality. 3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it. How to choose between 64/128gb: If you‚Äôre not really tight on budget, I‚Äôd suggest to go for 128gb variant. I‚Äôve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage occupied about 60gb. So it‚Äôd make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years. CONS: 1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price 2. If you‚Äôre an android user, migration would be little time consuming Update: I‚Äôve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :) Customer imageCustomer image 167 people found this helpful Helpful Report",128GB,Blue,Yes

13,Best phone,"
Pro Apple
1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.
And with a future update, facebook would not be able to track what you are doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud.

2. Battery
The battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus cannot touch this. If you bring this up with them, they will distract you by saying it has fast charging.

3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.

4. Build Quality - SOLID.

5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.

6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature would not work. Half baked implementation.",128GB,Blue,Yes
14,Absolutely loved the phone but price could have been bit cheaper,Amazing photography. Fast charging. Helpful Report,128GB,Black,Yes
15,Best phone,"I phone i must say having great optimization of software with hardware, more quality apps are available when compared to google, receiving a file is the only major pain i felt till now,
Battery backup is really good 2800 mAh in apple is almost like 5000mAh in android am not kidding, i have rog phone 3 it is 6000 mAh but at the end of the day the i phone has almost same % left, may be it is due to the less hz display.
Despite of having 60Hz display it feels good
And what can i say the speakers are loud and clear compared with rog 3.
45k should have been the right price for 64gb model but for 53k it is not a bad deal either, if you ask me spending 50k for an android is not worth since i phone has all hardware and software superiority.
No charger is a big let down by apple. And finally 64gb is good enough if you ask me as most of those having wifi connection can easily upgrade to i cloud paying just 75rs/Month and for the average 3 years of use the price will be still 2700rs in three year. For the 128gb i had to pay 8000rs more so still i am saving around 5300rs if i chose to use i cloud from the starting day.
No Finger print sensor , but it is ok the face id does it right but yes the finger print should be good. And for the notch it is ok. I phone 12 and 13 has virtually no difference so y to waste 20k more money buying the 13 just for the bit improvement of camera and brightness, hope you like my review üôÇ",128GB,Black,Yes
16,"READ before BUY ! ""Iphone 12! Worth buying or not?""","From owner POV, It is completely different experience for me as I have come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I am lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.

As per the limitations :

1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it does not feel like one)
2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.
3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)
4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)
5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name is not Sanjib ""Ambani"" ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)

Advantages:

1. It is a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it is best in the market.
2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)
3. Display (Cannot find much difference if you are a Samsung flagship user.)
4. The design and in-hand feel.
5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it is premium.

Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)

On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.
But iPhone 12 in 2020? its a technological wonder. It is very slim, premium and beautiful.
If you are comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience.",128GB,Black,Yes
17,Best phone,"First let me tell u it is a real beauty and this my first phone which is a iPhone....I was really excited about it to come to me as fast as possible........and before that I used Android phones which was my mom as I was a teenager ...So it is been 1 week It came...it is not a bid deal you know to go from Android to iPhone you know..In just one day I got accustomed to it.....let me tell you... that you cannot download MP3 music in iPhone where In Android it is a easy peasy thing....which I knew after receiving iPhone.....which would be a real bother to music alcoholic people...in those count me too....and please go with 128 gb if you want to buy because from 128 gb, 17 gb have already used in iOS system....which would be a real problem to you if you guys buy 64 gb variant...The camera is is really good factor...my siri is lightly having problem..it is always like ""Something went wrong! Please try again ""..I know i would happen to solve this problem too : ) .......I bought iPhone as because it is beast in case of CAMERAS...and it went really good price in the Great Indian Festival Of Amazon.....And Lastly but not least...",128GB,Blue,Yes
18, Great purchase!,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but could not buy them somehow. I wasn not and I am not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.
As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn not eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.
Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I am quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.
When it comes to iPhone 12, it as a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I am gonna used to of it.
I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.
INR 3000‚Çπ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000‚Çπ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000‚Çπ. Unfortunately Charging Brick is not included and it coasted 1900‚Çπ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.
Overall it is a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure.",128GB,Blue,Yes
19,Best selling phone in the world!!!,"No wonder Apple makes some of the best phones in the world. Iphone 12 deservedly is the highest selling phone.

I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.

The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.

The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what is to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.

The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.

Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there is no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it is as advertised.

Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it is prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase.",128GB,Black,Yes
20,Incrediable Phone,"IPhone 12 is probably the best option to start or enter into the ios ecosystem.Here are the advantages of iphone 12:
1.The best camera phone,photos are amazing nad the video quality is even more better.
2.The performance is just top notch.No complaints at all.
3.The IOS is best at everything.No lags at all or almost.
4.The display is just amazing.It could feel a bit small, if you are shifting from an android,but the display quality is great.

Here are a few disadvantages:
1.The battery will last a whole day only if you are a moderate to light user.
2.The file transfer to an android device is a big hassle.

21,Great for it being Used,"Battery health came with 98%. The phone have minuscule dents/scratches, but nothing excessive and you really had to search for the any prior use/wear. This was my best experience purchasing a phone not only for the quality but for the price. The phone is unlocked, so I did not need to worry about my coverage. It was easy to transfer and set everything up on my new phone without having to call my coverage provider. The package came with a new charger, so you could set everything up at one‚Äôs earliest convenience. It was cheaper than buying a brand new phone from Apple, but the quality I received was practically out of the box new with the 98% battery health and little to no damage to the phone.",128GB,Black,Yes
22, Works fine!,"The phone itself functions as its supposed to, but I feel like it could have been cleaned a little better before selling and there were a few small imperfections on the screen as well. Overall, it does what it needs to do and I am just glad to have a functioning phone",128GB,Black,Yes
23,Get what you paid for!!,"Received a phone a day after ordering overall the phone is pretty decent for the price that you pay. There are cosmetic damages here and there, particularly around The charge port and around the frame of the phone little dense here and there, but the phone itself is operational and functional.
And also the charger that comes in the box, it‚Äôs not even an Apple charger!!",64GB,Black,Yes
24,Highly Recommend,"I am a 19 year old broke college student, but I have had the Iphone XR since my freshman year of highschool... I am a rising junior now. Though my XR did my well over the years, she recently started shutting off on me at random times, would die after 30 minutes of use after being charged fully. I was just wayyyy past due for a new phone, so I got this one. This was one of my first big girl purchases, so I was a little worried that something was going to be wrong with the phone, seeing as I saw quite a few reviews complaining of issues with their phones, but I have not had any problems yet. Face ID works perfectly, extremely minor scratches (so unnoticeable I was only able to tell because I was strictly looking for them), easy to switch over to my carrier (literally just inserted the old sim card, and 30 minutes later EVERYTHING transferred over with no issues). Honestly, this is a REALLY good deal if you are looking for a more cheap route than having to buy a phone straight from Apple.
",64GB,Blue,Yes
25,Great Way To Save Some Money,"I got the renewed for 289. Bought this for my mother who loses things a lot so getting something in pristine condition for under 300 dollars is a great way to avoid the expense of a new phone with features that would go unused/unnoticed. Mine appeared brand new so was probably immediately placed in an Otter Box at time of original purchase. Battery seems ok but only time will tell but Apple only warranties new batteries for year anyway. Also came unlocked with no SIMM card and wiped clean just like my new 12 I got 3 years ago. Only took about 10 minutes to add to my Spectrum Mobile account. Only think I will add has nothing to do with the device but to keep in mind with a third-party seller. Price dropped around 40 bucks as soon as I received it. Did not expect Amazon to or the seller to honor it but spent about 15 minutes on their chat only to call a live rep. Then was told they have no control over 3rd party pricing as it is up to the seller. Again, not a big deal but just annoying that I could not get this answer in a minute or two though chat. Finally, if something does go wrong, I was told I would have to work with the seller instead of Amazon and discuss warranty with them. All in all 5 star for item and the latter part of this review is really more of a rant on the quality of Amazon Customer Service over the last 12 years of being a member

28,Yes but one issue,"I really do like the phone, I got the refurbished excellent quality, it charges relatively fast and dies just as fast, the main thing I cannot stand about it though is how fast it overheats, I‚Äôm unsure if this is just an iPhone 12 problem or whatever the case may be, but I do despise how due to it overheating it sometimes moves faster than the phone I replaced.

I‚Äôve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021),  apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra.

If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.Hope this review helped :)Update:13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch.

30,Excellent product; please purchase if your data is crucial.,"The iPhone 12 is the latest iteration of Apple's iconic smartphone series, and it continues to impress with its sleek design, powerful performance, and impressive camera capabilities. As a proud owner of the iPhone 12, I'd like to share my experiences and thoughts in this review.Design and Build Quality (5/5):Apple's design philosophy shines through in the iPhone 12. The flat-edged, aerospace-grade aluminum frame feels premium and comfortable to hold. The Ceramic Shield front cover offers extra durability, making me feel more confident in everyday use. The device is available in a variety of stunning colors, and the Super Retina XDR OLED display is simply brilliant, providing vibrant colors and deep blacks.Performance (5/5):Equipped with Apple's A14 Bionic chip, the iPhone 12 delivers top-notch performance. It handles multitasking, gaming, and demanding apps with ease. The device feels incredibly responsive, and I've never experienced any lag or slowdown, even with resource-intensive tasks.Camera (4.5/5):The iPhone 12 features a dual-camera system with a 12 MP wide and ultra-wide lens. The Night mode and Deep Fusion technology excel in low-light conditions, and the Smart HDR 3 makes every shot look stunning. However, compared to its more expensive sibling, the iPhone 12 Pro, it lacks a telephoto lens. Nonetheless, for the average user, the camera quality is more than satisfactory.iOS 15 (5/5):The iPhone 12 runs on iOS 15, which is Apple's latest and most feature-rich operating system. It's intuitive, secure, and keeps your device up-to-date. The App Library and widgets have been great additions, enhancing the user experience. Privacy features like App Tracking Transparency are commendable.Battery Life (4/5):While the iPhone 12's battery life is decent, it may not be the best among its competitors. It comfortably gets me through a full day of moderate use, but power users might need a top-up in the evening. However, the MagSafe wireless charging and support for fast charging (adapter sold separately) make it convenient to juice up quickly.5G Connectivity (4.5/5):With 5G support, the iPhone 12 is future-proofed for faster data speeds and improved connectivity. While 5G coverage may vary by region, it's an added bonus for those planning to keep their device for a few years.Conclusion:The iPhone 12 strikes an excellent balance between style and substance. It's a device that caters to the needs of a broad user base, offering impressive performance, a stunning display, and a camera that captures beautiful moments. iOS 15 brings a plethora of features to the table, and the device's design is nothing short of elegant. While battery life and the absence of a telephoto lens might deter some, for most users, the iPhone 12 is a fantastic choice, providing a premium Apple experience without the premium price tag.

32,Excellent product; please purchase if your data is crucial.,"The iPhone 12 is the latest iteration of Apple's iconic smartphone series, and it continues to impress with its sleek design, powerful performance, and impressive camera capabilities. As a proud owner of the iPhone 12, I'd like to share my experiences and thoughts in this review.Design and Build Quality (5/5):Apple's design philosophy shines through in the iPhone 12. The flat-edged, aerospace-grade aluminum frame feels premium and comfortable to hold. The Ceramic Shield front cover offers extra durability, making me feel more confident in everyday use. The device is available in a variety of stunning colors, and the Super Retina XDR OLED display is simply brilliant, providing vibrant colors and deep blacks.Performance (5/5):Equipped with Apple's A14 Bionic chip, the iPhone 12 delivers top-notch performance. It handles multitasking, gaming, and demanding apps with ease. The device feels incredibly responsive, and I've never experienced any lag or slowdown, even with resource-intensive tasks.Camera (4.5/5):The iPhone 12 features a dual-camera system with a 12 MP wide and ultra-wide lens. The Night mode and Deep Fusion technology excel in low-light conditions, and the Smart HDR 3 makes every shot look stunning. However, compared to its more expensive sibling, the iPhone 12 Pro, it lacks a telephoto lens. Nonetheless, for the average user, the camera quality is more than satisfactory.iOS 15 (5/5):The iPhone 12 runs on iOS 15, which is Apple's latest and most feature-rich operating system. It's intuitive, secure, and keeps your device up-to-date. The App Library and widgets have been great additions, enhancing the user experience. Privacy features like App Tracking Transparency are commendable.Battery Life (4/5):While the iPhone 12's battery life is decent, it may not be the best among its competitors. It comfortably gets me through a full day of moderate use, but power users might need a top-up in the evening. However, the MagSafe wireless charging and support for fast charging (adapter sold separately) make it convenient to juice up quickly.5G Connectivity (4.5/5):With 5G support, the iPhone 12 is future-proofed for faster data speeds and improved connectivity. While 5G coverage may vary by region, it's an added bonus for those planning to keep their device for a few years.Conclusion:The iPhone 12 strikes an excellent balance between style and substance. It's a device that caters to the needs of a broad user base, offering impressive performance, a stunning display, and a camera that captures beautiful moments. iOS 15 brings a plethora of features to the table, and the device's design is nothing short of elegant. While battery life and the absence of a telephoto lens might deter some, for most users, the iPhone 12 is a fantastic choice, providing a premium Apple experience without the premium price tag.

33,Confused? Read on! One stop review for your flagship purchase.,"I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I‚Äôve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021),  apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra.  If you read a few reviews you‚Äôll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues  and 9pro cameras didn‚Äôt live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand5. The haptics are spot onWhat‚Äôs Missing: (Minor misses though)1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you‚Äôll get used to it.2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensorWait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:It took a while for 12‚Äôs prices to fall.  If you‚Äôre willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.64GB or 128GB:The difference is around ‚Çπ6000.  64GB if you don‚Äôt play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128üòäBattery:I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to  it‚Äôs competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.Android Flagship Option:The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship.
